It's the best of both worlds. You get the computer use capability of Operator and also the in-depth analysis of Deep Research built into one.\n\nSo it can write code, use the terminal, create presentations, spreadsheets, images, research through dozens of websites and you can even interrupt it to add new instructions.\n\nHere's some tasks I asked it to execute:\n\n1. Stock Finder + Analysis + Presentation\nIt picked stocks using a criteria I provided, researched more about the pros and cons of each company and presented it to me in a ppt which I can show to anyone.\n\n2. In-Depth Trip Planning\nI asked it to plan everything for a company off-site and do it under a mentioned budget. It went through 10s of websites and came up with the best options and costs for travel, stay, eating, activities, etc.\n\n3. Shopping on Quick Commerce\nI asked it to use blinkit to order the ingredients for cooking paneer butter masala at home. It used Deep Research to figure out the ingredients, added them to the cart, and proceeded to checkout before handing it off to me for payment.\n\n4. Hiring for MarkitUp\nI asked it to log-in and use my LinkedIn account to search for YouTube Managers that I can hire at my company in Bengaluru full time. It took 30 minutes but gave me a spreadsheet with 10\u201315 potential candidates who want to switch, get hired and live in blr or are open to relocate and have significant YouTube experience.\n\nWe're just scratching the surface.\n\n- It can go through your unread emails overnight and collate the ones which are important for you to reply.\n- It can go through your calendar and get you ready for your daily meetings in advance.\n- Research competitors and do SWOT analysis.\n\nand much more!\n+ All these tasks can continue running in the background at the same time.\n\nWith tools like ChatGPT Agent, there's soo much that you can achieve as a single person. The future truly belongs to the one person businesses.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nHave you tried ChatGPT Agent?\n\nhashtag#chatgpt hashtag#ai hashtag#openai hashtag#technology hashtag#business hashtag#startup",

People get visual cues faster than titles and hence, the skill to create catchy thumbnails has quickly grown in demand. So much so that, graphic design now has a new niche called thumbnail designers.\n\nThese are graphic designers who understand the psychology of a user on youtube and knows how to use design to make them stop scrolling and grab attention.\n\nUsing the right colors, facial expressions, imagery, before/after and big bold text have all helped me create thumbnails that get over 9% CTR(click-through rate).\n\nCatchy thumbnails drive video clicks, which drives user retention which tells youtube to recommend this video to more people, hence driving up Impressions.\n\nI'm looking to urgently hire 2 full time thumbnail designers for my team and MarkitUp.\n\nIf you obsess over thumbnails and psychology and are willing to relocate to our bangalore office, I'm offering above market salaries and a bonus for your skill.\n\nApply now.\nLink is in the first comment.\n\nhashtag#youtube hashtag#graphicdesign hashtag#bangalore hashtag#startup hashtag#socialmedia",

Solved every coding question with his problem solving skills optimizing time and data.\n\nBut then came the final HR round.\n\nThe question? What would you do if you see an infant baby crying in the middle of the road?\n\nHe said \"I'll run up to the phone booth and call 911\".\n\nThe recruiter ended the meeting and walked him out.\n\nSatya was shocked. Upon asking the recruiter, he said \"If you see a crying baby, the first thing you do is pick up and hug them before calling anyone. You need empathy\"\n\nEmpathy.\nSatya eventually got the job but this word stayed with him forever.\n\nInstilling empathy in everything he did at the company. Hearing everyone's POV and creating an inclusive culture. Asking deeper questions, taking feedback and making people feel seen.\n\nI was at the Microsoft office in Redmond recently and I could see it all around me.

I'd always heard of it but never tried it yet and was curious. The price per seat was 3x the regular ticket and FnB was easily 1.5\u20132x expensive.\n\nIs the reclining seat, gourmet food worth the price?\n\nApparently YES.\n\nInfact, these luxury theatres are driving a major chunk of the profit.\n\nIt costs them slightly more to build these luxury theatres but they make up for it in much higher spend per head.\n\nLet's assume you paid 900rs for a PVR Luxe seat, PVR keeps 225\u2013270rs as its share. That's literally what a regular ticket costs.\n\nBut this is where it gets crazier. PVR makes its highest profit on FnB, upto 75%. So if you order food worth 500rs, PVR keeps 375rs as profit.\n\nThat's ~600rs in total profit per person.\n\nHence luxury theatre formats have been increasingly profitable for PVR.\n\nAnd rising middle class is willing to spend 2\u20133x more for an enhanced experience.\n\nHave you tried it?\ud83d\udc40\n\nLet me know your thoughts below!\n\nhashtag#pvr hashtag#business hashtag#consumerism hashtag#movies hashtag#cinema",

This cloud kitchen (Khichdi Bar) had an eye-catching dialogue appealing to the youth and their spin on the traditional Khichdi recipe.\n\nMaking a boring affair like having Khichdi feel fun, novel and cool again.\n\nThis is an excellent branding example for how to stand out in a crowded market. While costing the same as other competitors, they managed to get creative with the packaging.\n\nI really appreciate non-premium brands that go above and beyond to wow the users, be it Indigo with their clever copywriting inside their planes or Whole Truth Foods with their honest statements.\n\nThis also prompts customers to share the meal on social, increasing the word of mouth marketing.\n\nMost D2C brands focus on advertising their product without focussing first on reinventing their brand and how it looks. The unboxing experience has to wow the user, as Steve Jobs used to talk and obsess over.\n\nHave you noticed a similar example recently?\n\nLet me know below!\n\nhashtag#branding hashtag#marketing hashtag#business hashtag#startup hashtag#zomato",

Why?...\n\n8 in 10 employees use spreadsheets at least once every day.\n\nSadly, 57% people report having no or only basic Excel skills. Many are unable to write basic Excel functions and formulas or create charts and tables to visualize data.\n\nThis is because of:\n- Lack of formal training\n- Complexity of most spreadsheet apps\n- Learning by trial and error leading to mistakes\n\nIf this relates to you, I found an EPIC AI tool that's quickly replacing traditional spreadsheets.\n\nQuadratic is a free AI tool that can create tables, write formulas, make charts,\nAll by just typing plain English!\n\nImagine being able to interact with your spreadsheet and watch it generate reports and insights in real time.\n\nYou can even switch to code view and edit the Python if you are a developer yourself. This way, you can customize your charts, tweak the formulas, and make it look exactly how you want.\n\nImporting data is super simple:\n\u2022 Upload any CSV file directly\n\u2022 Connect your database (PostgreSQL, MySQL)\n\u2022 Copy and paste from existing spreadsheets\n\nNo more struggling with complex formulas or wasting hours formatting charts. Just ask for what you need and watch it execute!\ud83d\ude80\n\nIt's perfect for students, business analysts, and working professionals.\n\nTry it for free with the link in my comments.
